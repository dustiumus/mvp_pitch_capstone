    Problem to Solve:
                    With this App, I wish to solve the problem of Games getting reviewed by the wrong people and people missing out on great
        experiences because of it. This App will let you leave honest reviews about games that you have played and loved. Helping others who
        may miss out on the experience of a lifetime because of negative revies by reporters, non-gamers or just the plain lame gamer who 
        really shouldn't be playing anything but Fortnite.
